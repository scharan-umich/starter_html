            <p>
                The Apostle Islands are a collection of 22 islands in Lake Superior located in the northern region of Wisconsin, USA. Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people, the islands contain over hundreds of years worth of rich Native American history. In 1970, 21 of the islands and the surrounding waters were designated as the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, a protected area managed by the National Park Service. Lastly, the islands are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including, white-tailed deer, black bears and various bird species.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are six lighthouses spread across the islands, making it one of the largest collections of lighthouses in the United States. When the island receives visitors it is viewed as a popular destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, sailing, hiking and camping. In addition, many people enjoy other activities such as berry picking. Camping is also allowed in 19 of the 21 islands to date.

            <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
            <img src="images/chicago_river_north.gif" width=400 alt="A pedestrian view of tall Chicago skyscrapers, with a train moving in the corner of the image">
            <img src="images/chicago_river_north.jpg" width=400 alt="A pedestrian view of tall Chicago skyscrapers, with a train in the corner of the image">

            <p>
                On October 8, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire occurred destroying many buildings, miles of street, and leaving one-third of the city’s population homeless. The result of this was the “Great Rebuilding” which was a time period of heightened level of construction, new styles of architecture, innovative buildings, and sprouting economic growth. More than one hundred years ago, the world’s first double-deck trunnion bascule bridge opened on West Lake street. The towers and buildings around this bridge are different types of corporate offices, firms, business centers, restaurants, stores, apartments, condominiums, and hotels along with parks and tourist attractions.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes Chicago unique compared to all the other cities in the United States is that it has the most bridges, it inspired Gotham City, world renowned pieces of art, skyscrapers with multiple architectural styles, and the flow of the river is reversed. What once was a rail yard and parking lot, transformed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to become the Millenium Park to celebrate the passage of the second millennium. The Navy Pier was created with the intention of being a shipping and recreation facility and later evolved into premiere entertainment and exposition center. Due to the anti-Chinese sentiment and Chinese immigrants escaping violence, the Chinatown Square opened in 1993 from the efforts of Chinese activists demanding more land.
